# DeskNote
A WPF Windows-desktop notes-tool  

This was one of my first WPF-Projects, already 10 years ago... and I still use it regularily   
  
I'll start by simply sharing it here now - later I will try to document it better   
But there's a lot of stuff in there - Well, honestly I don't remember all of the things I did :D  

Recently I realised that I followed the wrong track by storing the contents in xaml  
With xaml You can't store images and hyperlinks and more - I once made a workaround for the hyperlinks, which is still useful for scanning the text for links  
Now, as I started sharing all my little helpers, I stumbled over the image problem and found that one could simply store the content in Rtf-format  
And as a bonus the size of the Rtf-data is ~ 1/3 of the xaml-data  

General  
  
there is a main control that manages the notes, or one may better say 'notebooks' - where each 'notebook' may consist of several pages (I store the interesting verses of my daily bible-reading there, and over the year it gets filled up to 2000 pages :D )
With the control you can create a new 'notebook', show it, hide it, delete it, send it to desktop-background...
